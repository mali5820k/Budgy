# Krait-Script
  - A personal project that stems from an interest of creating compilers and programming languages.

### Project Goals:
  - Create a compiler in C# that outputs IL to be ran on CLR as a .NET language.
  - Create a simple to learn scripting language that has comparable performance to compiled languages like C# and Java, and comparable simplicity to Python.
  - Interface with .NET languages for actual usefulness in development applications like a networked server.
  - Capable of being compiled AOT (Ahead Of Time) for published applications.
  - Cross-platform code, write once - run anywhere - mindset.
